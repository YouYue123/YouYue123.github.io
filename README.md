## How to run locally

First, you need to install Jekyll and the dependencies of { Personal } by running:

```shell
./scripts/install
```

Then, you can build and serve your website by simply running:

```shell
./scripts/serve-production
```

To serve across lan (requires su to forward the port 4000 over lan):

```shell
./scripts/serve-lan-production
```
