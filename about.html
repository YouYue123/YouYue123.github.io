## About

I am working as fullstack engineer in IBM Singapore. My research work is mainly in Computer Vision area.
I have implemented an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQHGB3Xtp1Q" target="_blank">non-GPS indoor navigation system</a> when I was in NTU Rose Lab
My enthusiasm is in using cool technology staff to make everybody's life easier like AirBnB && Google!!!
